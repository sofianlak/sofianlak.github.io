## **Who am I?**

![Desktop View](/assets/img/sofianlak.png){: width="180" height="200" .w-40 .left}
**Sofian Lakhdar** has built his career around **`DevOps`** practices and **`Site Reliability Engineering`** (SRE). He is guided by values inspired from sports: self-improvement, continuous learning, team spirit, and solidarity. These principles permeate both his professional and personal life, enabling him to approach each challenge with commitment.

A passionate **`cyclist`** and **`adventurer`**, he discovers new cultures while traveling by bike, and when not traveling, he escapes through travelers' stories, nurturing his taste for exploration, encounters, and personal growth.

## **Why this blog?**

This blog aims to **`share`** theoretical and practical knowledge about SRE and DevOps, essential fields for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of IT services. These topics can often seem complex for beginners. Using **`simple diagrams`**, I seek to make these concepts more accessible, whether for those who are just starting out or for those who wish to deepen their skills in SRE and DevOps.

This blog also reflects my learning journey in this field and my passion for **`discovery`**, both technically and in life, while also exploring other subjects that interest me.
